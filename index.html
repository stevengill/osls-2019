                <aside class="notes">In late 2016, we started investigating what Open Source looked like across
                    the company.</br>
                    - Where to start? First, we did an audit of all the OS resources/programs/successful pockets.</br>
                    - We wanted to hear from developers

                    - We formed
                    the OSO at the end of 2016.<br />
                    - Linux leadership summit.</br>
                    - It was a grass roots
                    type effort, with us only working on it part time. <br />
                    - The 3 original members were essentially volunteers as they
                    had other responsibilities as part of their day jobs.<br />
                    - The thing that brought us together was a shared love of open
                    source and a desire to have Adobe give back to
                    the community.<br />
                    - OSO had one clear goal and that was to help grow OS at Adobe.</br>
                    - Help teams open source projects and contribute back and to make OS a key pillar to Adobe's
                    development culture

                    - One huge benefit of how we started, diverse representation we had from all areas of the company.</br>
                    - Community engineer who had experience, marketing who was plugged into channels, legal.</br>
                    - Our role is more about bringing people together. We see
                    ourselves as more of a central team to all of Adobe.</br>
                    - CTO/CEO</br>

                    - With no commitment to continue to support, many of those
                    35 orgs were abandoned without any notice.</br>

                <h2>Revamped OS Submission Process</h2>
                <aside class="notes">The first obvious thing to tackle was
                    the submission process! So we started to gather
                    all of the requirements from all of the various teams
                    involved in the OS process. We took those requirements
                    and created a checklist for teams to follow.</aside>
            </section>
            <section style="padding-top:0px">
                <img src="images/os-submission-form.png" style="margin-top: 0; width:75%" />
                <aside class="notes">
                    The new submission form is radically simpler.<br />
                    - We decided to remove the ambiguous questions for more
                    simple and direct ones - easier to understand for
                    developers (i.e. not written by lawyers).<br />
                    - We created categories of
                    open source submissions that would require different levels of approval.</br>
                    - Some that would only require the OSO approval, some that would require all stakeholders.<br />
                    - If there was one needing conflict of interest review (that the OSO can do) they wouldn't need to
                    fill out the
                    entire 53 item checklist.</br>
                    - It bolted on top of the existing process - Users
                    logged in with their enterprise Git account, and issues
                    were submitted to the existing issue tracker. No
                    surprises for anyone already involved, just a nice UI
                    on top of existing process.<br />

                <aside class="notes">We also created
                    a approvelist of previously approved
                    projects as well as a denylist of projects that were out
                    of bounds. <br />
                    - This means if one employee received approval for
                    contributing to a project, all other Adobe employees
                    could do so as well without needing to fill out forms or
                    ask for permission.<br />
                    - We integratated these
                    lists right into our submission form to give instant
                    approvals or denials. This significantly sped up our
                    approval times. </aside>

                Handbook

                <aside class="notes">
                    - Next, we wanted to create an open, centralized place for OS questions so we created a handbook.</br>
                    - Essentially: any questions that tend to come up from
                    newcomers, we make a note of it and see if the info can
                    fit into the handbook. In this way it organically grows
                    and becomes more useful over time.</br>

                    - Opensource.google.com/docs is a huge inspiration for
                    this. It is gold standard.</br>

                    - Today, our handbook contains centralized releasing
                    documentation(npm, docker, maven central, chef).
                    Info about how we manage github.com/adobe and how to get
                    access. Also contains info about our CLA.</br>

                    - The handbook started out with a focus open source, but
                    has been bleeding into a generic engineering handbook.</br>

                    - Goal is to open source it and hand it out to new hires
                    as part of onboarding

                    time to give out OS awards. We have two main categorizes:<br />
                    - Top contributor which is based on data
                    we pull from GitHub (which we will touch on in a few
                    slides).<br />
                    - Outstanding OS contributor which is based on
                    nominations from the company.<br />
                    - We have been working on more platforms for these awards like company all hands, team all hands,
                    internal blogs</br>
                    - We have been working on a
                    formal employee recognition program for OS which we hope
                    to launch this year after we pitch it to some execs.

                    It was really important for us to have ways to

                    promote Adobe OS projects to external developer
                    communites.<br />
                    - This one made a huge difference for us and one I'm particularly passionate about
                    What good is all the work we do, the things we build, the projects we OS if no one
                    knows about it?</br>

                    - First we created the internal developer
                    newsletter. We added every developer and PM at the company to the list and made
                    it like no other corporate communication. We keep it simple and useful<br />

                    - We use a git repo to take submissions for what to include so it functions like an OS project</br>

                    - We also created #guild-opensource. A company wide slack
                    channel to for all of the os enthusiests to gather and
                    discuss whatever is on their mind.<br />

                    We have yet to open source this project, but
                    it's an attempt at quantifying our ranking among
                    other companies.<br />
                    - every month we pound the github REST API and keep
                    track of user to company associations in our own
                    DB<br />
                    - we cross reference this information with commit
                    activity on GitHub<br />
                    - we stole Felipe Hoffa's (dev advocate at Google) approach from his blog
                    post on this topic, and expanded on it a bit<br />
                    - In 2017, we were ranked 56th with 38 unique contributors across 55 repositories</br>
                    - Only 38 contributors?! Original approach used GitHub user's git configuration email, but who
                    puts their company email in their git config?</br>
                    - Now we use the "company field" in GitHub profiles and use our internal communication channels
                    to encourage employees to add Adobe to their company field</br>
                    - Beginning of 2018 we sat at 34th with 115 unique contributors to projects w at least one star</br>

                    - Now we sit at 14th, thanks in no small part to the acquisition of Magento that has a HUGE
                    Open Source community</br>
                    - there are many flaws of this approach: we only count
                    commits as contributions (whereas we want to count
                    comments, PRs, reviews, etc.). the company-to-user
                    associations are rough at best. but that's ok.</br>

                    - Like I said, our narrative was originally that OS saved development time, created better
                    software, etc.
                    and we still got fast no's
                    - So we got creative and changed the narrative. We talked about OS as another channel to engage
                    with developers.</br>
                    - We talked about OS as a way to lend legitimacy and authenticity to our developer offerings</br>
                    - We found teams who had benefited in some ways from Open Source and talked about those constantly</br>
                    - We talked to HR about attracting and retaining talent through OS.</br>
                    - And we found and leveraged enthusiasts from around the company. Employees, especially executives,
                    who understood
                    and were enthusiastic about OS. We now have several executives that blog consistently, speak at our
                    conferences,
                    recognize employees in their orgs and demo new programs for the OSO.</br>
