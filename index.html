                        It's funny. When we first started work on changing Adobe's culture - "You think we don't, but we do." 
                        While Adobe and Open Source don't traditionally go hand in hand,
                        Adobe has been involved in OS and has many successful vibrant pockets of OS like open sourcing Brackets and 
                        Flex and contributing to many Apache projects.
                        You still wouldn't think of Adobe as an open source company.
                        Is this a perception problem or something else? We dug further.

                    <aside class="notes">In late 2016, we started investigating what Open Source looked like across 
                        the company.</br>
                    Where to start? First, we did an audit of all the OS resources/programs and we wanted to hear

                        - We formed
                        the OSO at the end of 2016.<br/>
                        - It was a grass roots
                        type effort, with us only working on it part time. <br/>
                        - The original members were essentially volunteers as they
                        had other responsibilities as part of their day jobs.<br/>
                        - The thing
                        that brought them together was a shared love of open
                        source and their desire to have Adobe give back to
                        the community.<br/>
                        - OSO had one clear goal and that was to help grow OS at Adobe. 
                        Help teams open source projects and contribute back.

                        Adobe is traditionally siloed
                        One huge benefit is our OSO is composed of a group of
                        developers, marketing and legal. Very rare to have
                        a cross organizational team like us in the company.
                        We sit under the developer relations org. Would be more
                        ideal if we sat under the CEOs office.

                        Our role is more about bringing people together. We see
                        ourselves as more of a central team to all of Adobe.

                    <aside class="notes">The next obvious thing to tackle was
                        the submission process! So we started to gather
                        all of the requirements from all of the various teams
                        involved in the OS process. We took those requirements
                        and created a checklist for teams to follow.</aside>
                </section>
                <section style="padding-top:0px">
                    <img src="images/os-submission-checklist.png" style="margin-top: 0; width:51%" />
                    <aside class="notes">
                  
                        - We went back and forth on what tool to use to manage the process.</br>
                        - We settled on creating a git repo on our
                        internal github. We put the checklist of all
                        of the requirements into a issue_template.<br/>
                        - Every
                        submitter was required to create an issue in our repo
                        and start filling out the checklist in the issue
                        template.<br/>
                        - One big benefit of this new process meant
                        that it was open and transparent. Anyone could view
                        previous submissions and see how they went. We wanted
                        to remove the mystery behind the approvals. <br/>
                        - Over time
                        and many discussions with various stakeholders, the list
                        grew to 53 items. The process was still daunting and
                        a little confusing.<br/>
                        - Our plan was for the checklist to
                        be a first pass. It was quick to get up and it allowed
                        us to build relationships with the stakeholders. It gave
                        us at the open source office time to learn the nuances
                        of contributing to and open sourcing code.<br/>
                        - So earlier
                        this year, from our learnings, we launched the new open
                        source submission form.

                    <aside class="notes">
                            The new submission form is radically simpler.<br/>
                            - We
                        decided to remove the ambiguous questions for more
                        simple and direct ones - easier to understand for
                        developers (i.e. not written by lawyers).<br/>
                        - We created categorizes of
                        open source projects that the open source office would
                        be able to approve without going through all of the
                        stakeholders.<br/>
                        - It bolted on top of the existing process - Users
                        logged in with their enterprise Git account, and issues
                        were submitted to the existing issue tracker. No
                        surprises for anynone already involved, just a nice UI
                        on top of existing process.<br/>

                        - This means if one employee received approval for

                        Essentially: any questions that tend to come up from
                        newcomers, we make a note of it and see if the info can
                        fit into the handbook. In this way it organically grows
                        and becomes more useful over time.

                        Opensource.google.com/docs is a huge inspiration for
                        this. It is gold standard.

                        Today, our handbook contains centralized releasing
                        documentation(npm, docker, maven central, chef).
                        Info about how we manage github.com/adobe and how to get
                        access. Also cotains info about our CLA

                        The handbook started out with a focus open source, but
                        has been bleeding into a generic engineering handbook.

                        Goal is to open source it and hand it out to new hires
                        as part of onboarding

                        - We also created #guild-opensource. A company wide slack
                        channel to for all of the os enthusiests to gather and

                    - We tried a myriad of things. When we first started out we got fast "no's" it was too risky, too time consuming, etc.
                    so we got creative about the way we talked about Open Source</br>
                    - We tied OS to a pressing business need - for Adobe, that is becoming a platform company
                    and what good is a platform without developers building on it?</br>
                    - We positioned OS as a great channel to connect to a customer segment that is a growing demographic at Adobe, the developer</br>
                    - We positioned OS as a way to lend transparency and authenticity to our developer offerings
                    - We positioned it as a way to gain credibility
                    - Lastly, we found enthusiasts across the company, leaders who understood and were enthusiastic about OS
                    and had them blog consistently, speak at our Open Source Summits, recognize employees in their org, and 
                    test out different programs we'd come up with

                            track of user to company associations in our own
                            DB<br/>
                            - we cross reference this information with commit
                            activity on GitHub<br/>
                            - we stole Felipe Hoffa's approach from his blog
                            post on this topic, and expanded on it a bit<br/>
                        - there are many flaws of this approach: we only count
                        commits as contributions (whereas we want to count
                        comments, PRs, reviews, etc.). the company-to-user
                        associations are rough at best. but that's ok.
